# Physical_Modeling
C and MATLAB implementations of fractional delay lines (circular buffers) based on linear interpolation and first order all pass methods. <br/>
They create a plucked string model on TITI L138 OMAP DSP board and also in MATLAB by extracting and using the excitation signal of a given musical sound.
